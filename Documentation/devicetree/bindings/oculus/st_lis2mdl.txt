/* Oculus thin IMU driver for ST LIS2MDL sensor */

Required properties:
	- compatible: should be "oculus,lis2mdl"
	- int1-gpio: interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ, it should by configured with
		     flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
	- vdd-supply = regulator supply for the device
	- vdd-voltage-min = min regulator voltage in uV for the device (32-bit val)
	- vdd-voltage-max = max regulator voltage in uV for the device (32-bit val)
	- vio-supply = regulator supply for the device
	- vio-voltage-min = min regulator voltage in uV for the device (32-bit val)
	- vio-voltage-max = max regulator voltage in uV for the device (32-bit val)
