config MISCFIFO

	default n
	---help---
	  Like seqfile, this driver provides file operations to
	  easily implement a chardev backed by a kfifo.

	  Drivers using this chardev only have to call one of the
	  send() functions to deliver events to userspace.

config MISCFIFO_SAMPLE
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver example"
	default n
	---help---
	  Example usage of miscfifo chardev driver

	  Kernel portion of sensor driver that implement a simple API.
	  This driver implements a thin interface that handles I/O, interrupts and
	  time-stamping.  The bulk of the driver implementation / state management
	  specific to the sensor device will be in userspace.

config OCULUS_LIS2MDL_I2C
	tristate "Thin ST LIS2MDL Mag Driver (Oculus Version)"
	default n
	depends on OF
	depends on I2C

	  Kernel portion of ST LIS2MDL Magnetometer driver
	  This driver implements a thin interface that handles I/O, interrupts and
	  time-stamping.  The bulk of the driver implementation / state management
	  will be in userspace.
